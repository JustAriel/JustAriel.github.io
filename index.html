            <p>and then since 2010 as the GT2 RS. It is based on the 911 Turbo</p>
            <p> and uses a similar twin-turbocharged engine, but features numerous upgrades, including engine enhancements</p>
            <p> The GT2 is significantly lighter than the Turbo due to its use of rear-wheel-drive instead of all-wheel-drive system</p>

        <h2 class="Tf">TF is porsche?</h2>
        <h3 class="History">In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, <br>
            so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine case from its internal combustion engine, <br>
            transmission, and several parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, <br>
            had several evolutionary stages, A, B, and C, while in production, <br>
            and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. <br>
            Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. <br>
            The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, <br>
            who also had designed the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, <br>
            featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle),
            rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.</h3>
        <h3 class="HistoryP2">In 1964, after a fair amount of success in motor-racing with various models including the 550 <br>
            and with the 356 needing a major re-design, the company launched the Porsche 911:<br>
            another air-cooled, rear-engined sports car, this time with a six-cylinder "boxer" engine.<br>
            The team to lay out the body shell design was led by Ferry Porsche's eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (F. A.). <br>
            The design phase for the 911 caused internal problems with Erwin Komenda,<br>
            who led the body design department until then. F. A. Porsche complained Komenda made unauthorized changes<br>
            to the design. Company leader Ferry Porsche took his son's drawings to neighbouring chassis manufacturer Reuter.<br>
            Reuter's workshop was later acquired by Porsche (so-called Werk 2).<br>
            Afterward, Reuter became a seat manufacturer, today known as Keiper-Recaro.</h3>
